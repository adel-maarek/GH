Master Thesis - Machine Learning Model in MATLAB

This repository contains the code and models developed as part of my Master's Thesis to determine the web crippling capacity for the sigma steel sections. The focus of this project was to design, train, and evaluate a machine-learning regression model using MATLAB. The project leverages MATLAB's Regression Learner for model training and optimization.
